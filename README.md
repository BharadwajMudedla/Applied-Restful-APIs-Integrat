# Applied-Restful-APIs-Integrat

This repository was created as part of a GitHub tutorial to practice the basic GitHub workflow.  
It was specifically created for the assignment in the subject **Applied RESTful APIs & Integration**, where I practiced creating repositories, managing branches, and working with pull requests.
